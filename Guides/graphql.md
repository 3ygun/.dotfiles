#### Enhancements

- Having readonly traffic go to the non-MySQL master
    - [With Spring JPA](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30938574/segregating-the-read-only-and-read-write-in-spring-j2ee-apps)
        - Add `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` to things and have a different `jdbc` connector string implementing this [ReplicationDriver](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-master-slave-replication-connection.html)

- [GraphQL Mutation Design: Anemic Mutations](https://medium.com/@__xuorig__/graphql-mutation-design-anemic-mutations-dd107ba70496)
    - Same advice different author [Designing GraphQL Mutations](https://blog.apollographql.com/designing-graphql-mutations-e09de826ed97)
    - Keep mutations simple and specific `AddItemToCheckout`, `AddBillingMethod`, etc. instead of all encompassing `UpdateCheckoutInput`
- [GraphQL Mutation Design: Hypermedia GraphQL API](https://medium.com/@__xuorig__/graphql-mutation-design-hypermedia-graphql-api-faf03f3a898a)
    - What's hypermedia?
        - A hypermedia-driven site provides information to navigate the siteâ€™s REST interfaces dynamically by including hypermedia links with the responses.
    - Why would you want this? (Best description)
        - "As for links, a lot of people use a REST API like a RPC API and ignore actions if present, but using those actions as a switch to know if you should be showing a button or not avoids having discrepancies between similar clients (iOS/web/etc). You should be using them for this instead of hoping your frontend clients are all magically getting their business logic correct across different teams."

## Auto Generate Output Type

- [Quicktype](https://blog.quicktype.io/graphql-with-quicktype/)
    - Commands:
        ```
        quicktype --graphql-introspect http://localhost:9000/graphql/schema.json --graphql-schema updox.gqlschema

        // Make some random query
        // Would need some queries that cover all cases in the app :P for direct auto-generation

        quicktype --src-lang graphql -l kotlin --graphql-schema updox.gqlschema query.graphql > thing.kt
        ```
