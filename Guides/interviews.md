1. I want to build a new service that crawls the internet for used bikes and presents them for sale. Roughly sketch out the architecture you would use and how all the parts fit together.
    - Why this question is good: it is impossible to successfully answer this question if you don't have experience building systems. Even if you try to BS it, your answer will come off shallow and break under any sort of probing. It also reveals how the dev's mind works when approaching problems.
2. Name your favorite tech stack. What is your favorite thing about it and what is your least favorite thing about it?
    - Why this question is good: any dev knows that every tech decision comes with good things and terrible things. I love Python, but GIL, circular imports, shitty deployment/package management, 2.x vs 3.x nonsense all suck. If you haven't been in the trenches, you can't answer this _specifically_... you can only answer it _broadly_. And it's very apparent right away to interviewer.

I had about 4 - 5 of these questions. None of them required a single line of code to be written.

From HackerNews comments:
1. Ask them about the challenges which they've faced when using x, y framework.
2. Ask them why they prefer one framework to another.
3. Ask them how they view testing
4. Walk through with them on a simple whiteboard problem and ask them where they would write test cases.
5. Watch for the amount of detail they give you. That will give you an indication of what kind of a developer and how deeply they go into problems.

1. Tell me about a challenging bug you've vanguished, what it was and how you solved it?
